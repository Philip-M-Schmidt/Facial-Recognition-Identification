# Facial-Recognition-Identification
Facial recognition and identification written in python using mainly the library OpenCV.
You will have to download the folder of the haarcasces which are provided by OpenCV and furthermore the pictures folder that you have to fill with a couple of pictures of persons you want to be identified.

face_recognition.py can be executed directly. It only recognizes the face of any person and draws a coloured rectangle around the face and the eyes in real time.

Before executing the face_identification.py script you need to run the face_machine_learning.py script that computes and learns how to identify the persons of which pictures you put inside the pictures folder before. 
A facetrainer.yml data will be created which is utilized by the final full application of the face_identifation.py script.

Enjoy you own personal facial recognition and identifaction app!
